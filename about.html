                                During the pandemic in 2020, I wanted to get back into reading. I wrote down what I read in my journal, and that helped motivate me to continue. Reading became a habit, and I was truly enjoying this new hobby.

                                When I told people that I have been reading more, they ask me what books I recommend. Most of the time, I don't have my journal with me, so I decided to create this website. I hope to add more to this website such as the genre of each book, interesting quotes, and my overall opinion of the book. While the website only contains books I have read in 2021, I plan to add all books I finished since getting back into reading.

                                I have been enjoying obtaining books as well. I am trying to buy used books to reduce the environmental impact I am making. I like to order books from Better World Books because they are also working towards helping the environment as well as promoting literacy by donating a book whenever anyone purchases a book from their site. However, I enjoy finding books in the free libraries around the community. I have found so many great books this way.

                                I hope my website and my story inspires others to read as well. There is no other feeling like being so absorbed in a book that you forget what is going on around you.
